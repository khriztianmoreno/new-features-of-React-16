# Leverage New Features of React 16

> This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

React 16 comes with some new and powerful features, in this repository we will explore each one of them. Each lesson will review each new individual feature, one at a time. Not only will we see the technical capabilities of the new functions, but we will also address the best practices.

Once you see this repository clones and review the examples you will be more than ready to take advantage of everything React 16 has to offer.
